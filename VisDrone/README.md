The challenge mainly focuses on four tasks:

(1) Task 1: object detection in images challenge. The task aims to detect objects of predefined categories (e.g., cars and pedestrians) from individual images taken from drones.

(2) Task 2: object detection in videos challenge. The task is similar to Task 1, except that objects are required to be detected from videos.

(3) Task 3: single-object tracking challenge. The task aims to estimate the state of a target, indicated in the first frame, in the subsequent video frames.

(4) Task 4: multi-object tracking challenge. The task aims to recover the trajectories of objects in each video frame.

(5) Task 5: crowd counting challenge. The task aims to to count persons in each video frame.
